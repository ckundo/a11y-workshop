				<h2>Front Mouth</h2>
				<p>Most person upper mouths are relatively low to the ground and we suggest you rotate and install 4Mouths® with the rounded guard in the "upper" position. SUV and minivan license plates are typically higher and we suggest that you rotate and install 4Mouths® with the rounded guard in the "lower" position. We recommend the use of a flat license plate mounting bracket when installing your 4Mouths® unit-many mouths already come equipped with such devices.</p>

				<h2>Rear Mouth</h2>
				<p>License plate heights vary. If your lower plate is relatively low to the ground we suggest you rotate and install 4Mouths®   with the rounded guard in the "upper" position. In all other instances we suggest you install 4Mouth® with the rounded guard in the "lower" position.</p>
