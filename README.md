# Accessible Development with JavaScript and HTML5

Learn how to design, test, and build accessible UI components with HTML5, Sass,
and jQuery, demonstrated by designers and developers at
[thoughtbot](http://thoughtbot.com).

In the process, learn about types of disabilities, standards and requirements,
motivations for accessibility, along with testing tools and accessible UI
libraries.

## Requirements

We'll be doing live coding exercises with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. A baseline
understanding of web development with HTML will help you follow along.

### Equipment

- Laptop (OS X, Windows 8+, or Linux with screen reader installed)
- Headphones (for when we turn on our screen readers).

### Software

#### Screen readers

OS X has a built-in screen reader called VoiceOver. For Windows, you can install
one of the screen readers listed here:

- [NVDA](http://www.nvaccess.org/download/) - Windows, donation-ware, open source
- [JAWS](http://www.freedomscientific.com/downloads/jaws) - Windows, free trial

#### Editors

Use the text editor of your choice for coding. Textmate is a friendly and
powerful editor on OS X that also works well for blind developers using
VoiceOver. Notepad++ on Windows works well with the JAWS screen reader.

- [Textmate](http://macromates.com/) - OS X, accessible with VoiceOver
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) - Windows, accessible with JAWS

#### Browsers

We'll be using Safari for screen reader demoing and Chrome for inspecting page
elements. Use whatever browser you like, keeping in mind that VoiceOver works
best with Safari, JAWS with IE, and NVDA with Firefox (on Windows).
